== Introduction

[quote, Jim Manico]
From my experience all software developers are now security engineers whether they know it, admit to it or do it.
Your code is now the security of the org you work for.

.Welcome to the **Reactive Spring Security 5 Hands-On Workshop**.

Target of this workshop is to learn how to make an initially unsecured (reactive) web application
more and more secure step-by-step.

You will make your hands dirty in code in the following steps:

1. Add spring boot security starter dependency for simple auto configuration of security
2. Customize authentication configuration (provide our own user store + encryption)
3. Add authorization (access controls) to web and method layers
4. Implement automated security integration tests
5. Experiment with an OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Client and Resource Server of Spring Security 5

=== Requirements for this workshop

* Git
* A Java JDK (Java 8, 11 or 14 are supported and tested)
* Any Java IDE capable of building with https://gradle.org/[Gradle] (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, ...)
* Basic knowledge of https://www.reactivemanifesto.org[Reactive Systems] and reactive programming using https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux[Spring WebFlux] & https://projectreactor.io[Reactor]
* https://curl.haxx.se[Curl] or https://httpie.org[Httpie] to call the REST API from command line
* https://robomongo.org[Robo 3T] to look inside the embedded MongoDB instance

As we are building the samples using https://gradle.org[Gradle] your Java IDE should be capable use this.
As IntelliJ user support for https://gradle.org/[Gradle] is included by default.
As an Eclipse user you have to install a plugin via the marketplace

.Eclipse Marketplace for Gradle integration
