== Lab 4: Security Testing

.Now it is time to prove that we have implemented these authorization rules correctly with automatic testing.

We start testing the rules on method layer for all operations regarding books.

.Automated security tests

image::images/workshop_lab_6.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Library service security tests"]

The tests will be implemented using the new JUnit 5 version as Spring 5.0 now supports this as well. +
In _BookServiceTest_ class we also use the new convenience annotation _@SpringJUnitConfig_ which is a shortcut of
_@ExtendWith(value=SpringExtension.class)_ and _@ContextConfiguration_.

As you can see in the following code only a small part is shown as a sample here to test the _BookService.create()_ operation.
Authorization should always be tested for positive *AND* negative test cases. Otherwise you probably miss an authorization
constraint. Depending on the time left in the workshop you can add some more test cases as you like or just look into the
completed application _04-library-server_.

.BookServiceAuthorizationTest class

include::../snippets/step-4-book-authorization-test.adoc[]

For sure you have to add similar tests as well for the user part.

.UserServiceAuthorizationTest class

include::../snippets/step-4-user-authorization-test.adoc[]

[CAUTION]
====
Make sure you always add positive and negative authorization tests. Otherwise you may miss
authorization endpoint leaks.
====

Another approach is to test the authentication for the reactive api.
This is shown in following class.

.BookApiAuthenticationTest

include::../snippets/step-4-book-authentication-test.adoc[]

The testing part is the last part of adding simple username/password based security to the reactive style of the _library-server_ project.
The next step will dive into the world of token-based authentication.

[NOTE]

You find the completed code in project **lab-4/complete-library-server**.
