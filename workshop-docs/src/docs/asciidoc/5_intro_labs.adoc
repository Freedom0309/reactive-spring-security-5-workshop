== Basic Security Labs

To start the workshop please begin by adapting the **lab-1/initial-library-server**

[NOTE]
====
If you are not able to keep up with completing a particular step you
always can just start over with the existing application of next step.

For example if you could not complete the lab 1 in time
just continue with lab 2 using **lab-1/complete-library-server** as new starting point.
====

=== Run the initial application

To ensure your java environment is configured correctly please run the initial
workshop application.

To achieve this run the class _com.example.library.server.InitialLibraryServerApplication_ in project **lab-1/initial-library-server**.

This should also start the embedded MongoDB instance. In case you get an error here telling that the corresponding port _40495_
is already bound to another service then please change the configuration to a different port in file _application.yml_:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      port: 40495
----

To look into the embedded MongoDB instance the UI tool https://robomongo.org/[Robo 3T] is
very helpful and easy to use. In case you did not yet install this tool just go to
https://robomongo.org/download and download the corresponding file for your operating system
(please do NOT download the commercial variant named _Studio 3T_).

After you downloaded the install file and extracted/installed the tool you have to configure
the connection to the embedded MongoDB like in the following figure.
If you have configured your embedded MongoDB instance to a different port then use that one
instead of _40495_.

Finally, you can navigate your web browser to http://localhost:9091/books then you
should see a list of books.

You can achieve the same on the command line using https://httpie.org/[httpie]
or https://curl.haxx.se/download.html[curl].

.Curl
[source,shell]
----
curl 'http://localhost:9091/books' | jq
----

.Httpie
[source,shell]
----
http localhost:9091/books
----

If both the workshop application and the Robo 3T tool run fine and you could see
the list of books then you are setup and ready to start the first lab.

So head over to the next section and start with Lab 1.
