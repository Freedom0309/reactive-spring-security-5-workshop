== OAuth2/OpenID Connect Labs

.In the last workshop part we will look at the new OAuth2 login client and resource server introduced in Spring Security 5.0 and 5.1.

=== Introduction

==== OAuth 2.0

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0] is the base protocol for authorizing 3rd party authentication services
for using business services in the internet like https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow].

.OAuth 2.0 role model

image::images/oauth2_roles.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="oauth_roles"]

Authorizations are permitted via scopes that the user has to confirm before
using the requested service.

Depending on the application type OAuth 2.0 provides the following grants (flows):

- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[Authorization Code Grant]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[Authorization Code Grant with PKCE]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2[Implicit Grant]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3[Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4[Client Credentials Grant]

The following picture shows the mechanics of the _Authorization Code Grant Flow_.

.Authorization code grant flow

==== OpenID Connect 1.0 (OIDC)

https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect 1.0 (OIDC)] is build upon https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth2] and provides additional identity information
to OAuth2. For common enterprise applications that typically require authentication OpenID Connect should be used.
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OIDC] adds https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON web tokens (JWT)] as mandatory format for id tokens to the spec.
In OAuth2 the format of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[bearer tokens] is not specified.

.OpenID Connect 1.0 role model

image::images/oidc_roles.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="openid_roles"]

OIDC adds an id token in addition to the access token of OAuth2 and specifies
a user info endpoint to retrieve further user information using the access token.

OIDC supports the following grant flows:

- https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow]
- https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth[Implicit Flow]
- https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth[Hybrid Flow]

==== Tokens in OIDC and OAuth 2.0

Tokens can be used in two ways:

1. Self-contained token (containing all information directly in token payload, e.g. JWT)
2. Reference token (token is used to look up further information)

==== OAuth2/OIDC in Spring Security 5

.Spring Security 5.0 introduced new support for OAuth2/OpenID Connect (OIDC) directly in spring security.

In short Spring Security 5.0 adds a completely rewritten implementation for OAuth2/OIDC which now is largely based
on a third party library https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-oauth-openid-connect-sdk[Nimbus OAuth 2.0 SDK] instead of implementing all these functionality directly in Spring itself.

Spring Security 5.0 only provides the client side for servlet-based clients.

Spring Security 5.1 adds the resource server support and reactive support
for reactive clients and resource server as well.

Spring Security 5.2 adds client support for authorization code flow with PKCE.

Spring Security 5.3 will add a basic OAuth2/OIDC authorization server again (for local dev
and demos but not for productive use).

Before Spring Security 5.0 and Spring Boot 2.0 to implement OAuth2 you needed the separate project module
https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth2].

Now things have changed much, so it heavily depends now on the combination of Spring Security and Spring Boot versions
that are used how to implement OAuth2/OIDC.

Therefore you have to be aware of different approaches for Spring Security 4.x/Spring Boot 1.5.x
and Spring Security 5.x/Spring Boot 2.x.

^3^ No direct support in Spring Security 5.0/Spring Boot 2.0. For auto-configuration with Spring Boot 2.0
you still have to use the separate https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth project]
together with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth2-boot[Spring Security OAuth2 Boot compatibilty project] +
^4^ New refactored support for resource server as part of Spring Security 5.1 +
^5^ OAuth2 login client and resource server with reactive support as part of Spring Security 5.1. +
^6^ New OAuth2 authorization server is planned as part of Spring Security 5.2

[TIP]
====
The OAuth2/OpenID Connect Authorization Server provided by Spring Security 5.3 will mainly suit for fast prototyping and demo
purposes. For production please use one of the https://openid.net/developers/certified/[officially certified] products like for example
https://www.keycloak.org/[KeyCloak], https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa[UAA], https://identityserver.io[IdentityServer], https://auth0.com[Auth0] or https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/[Okta].

In this workshop we will now look at what Spring Security 5.1 provides as new
OAuth2/OIDC Login Client and Resource Server - In a reactive way.

==== What we will build

In **lab-5** you will be provided the following sub-projects:

* *initial-resource-server*: The initial library server (almost similar to workshop step **lab-1/initial-library-server**)

* *complete-resource-server*: The completed OIDC resource server (as reference)

In *lab-6* you will be provided the following sub-projects:

* *initial-oidc-client*: Initial code for this workshop part to implement the new OAuth2 Login Client

* *complete-oidc-client*: Complete code of the new OIDC Client (as reference)

[NOTE]
====
The spring implementation of the authorization server previously used (based on Spring Boot 1.5.x) is not
fully compliant with OIDC and therefore not usable any more with OAuth2/OIDC implementation
of Spring Security 5.1.
====

.Library client, service and identity provider service

image::images/workshop_lab_7.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="OAuth2 spring roles"]

These micro-services have to be configured to be reachable via the following URL addresses (Port 8080 is the default port in spring boot).

.Microservice & Identity Provider URL Adresses
|===
|Service |URL
|Identity Management Service (Keycloak)
|http://localhost:8080/auth[http://localhost:8080/auth]
|Library Client (OIDC Client)
|http://localhost:9090[http://localhost:9090]
|Library Server (OIDC Resource Server)
|http://localhost:9091[http://localhost:9091]
|===

So now let's start.
Again, you will just use the provided _keycloak_ identity management server, the *lab-5/initial-resource-server*
and the *lab-6/initial-oidc-client* as starting point and implement
an OAuth2/OIDC resource server and client based on the project.

But first read important information about how to setup and start the required _keycloak_ identity management server.

[[identity-server]]
=== Setup: Keycloak Identity Server

For this workshop the OpenID Connect certified https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak identity provider server] is used.
This provider supports solutions for authentication, authorization and user administration.
For our purposes we will use this service to issue OpenID Connect compliant JSON web tokens (JWT).

To setup the local keycloak server please copy/extract it from provided USB sticks
or follow the setup instructions at https://tinyurl.com/y2mqyeua.

[TIP]
====
You may look into https://openid.net/certification/[OpenID Connect certified products]
to find a suitable identity management server for your project.
====

Every OpenID Connect 1.0 compliant identity server must provide a page at the endpoint _/.../.well-known/openid-configuration_

To see the configuration please open the following url in your web browser:
http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/.well-known/openid-configuration[Well known OIDC configuration]

The important information provided by this is:

.Identity Server Configuration
|===
|Entry |Description |Value
|issuer
|Issuer url for issued tokens by this identity server
|http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop
|authorization_endpoint
|Handles authorization, usually asking for credentials and returns an authorization code
|http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/auth
|token_endpoint
|Token endpoint (exchanges given authorization code for access token)
|http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/token
|userinfo_endpoint
|Endpoint for requesting further user information
|http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
|jwks_uri
|Uri for loading public keys to verify signatures of JSON web tokens
|http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/certs
|===

To login into your local keycloak use the following user credentials:

* Username: admin
* Password: admin

The keycloak identity service has been preconfigured with the following user credentials
for the workshop application:

.User credentials
|===
| Username | Email | Password | Roles
|bwayne
|bruce.wayne@example.com
|wayne
|LIBRARY_USER
|bbanner
|bruce.banner@example.com
|banner
|LIBRARY_USER
|pparker
|peter.parker@example.com
|parker
|LIBRARY_CURATOR
|ckent
|clark.kent@example.com
|kent
|LIBRARY_ADMIN
|===

[[auth-code-demo]]
=== Intro-Lab: Authorization Code Demo Client

In this introduction lab you can see the authorization code grant flow step-by-step in detail.

Please make sure that you have started keycloak server.
Then check this out, go to project **intro-labs/auth-code-demo** and run the class _com.example.authorizationcode.client.AuthorizationCodeDemo_.

[[resource-server]]
=== Lab 5: OpenID Connect Resource Server

For this workshop part the well-known library-server application is used and will be extended to act
as a OAuth2 resource server.

[[resource-server-gradle-dependencies]]
==== Gradle dependencies

To use the new OAuth2 resource server support of Spring Security 5.1 you have to add the
following required dependencies to the existing gradle build file.

.gradle.build file

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-resource-server-gradle-build.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
These dependencies already have been added to the initial project.
====

[TIP]
====
You may look into the spring security oauth2 boot reference documentation
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security-oauth2-server[Spring Boot 2.1 Reference Documentation]
and the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.1.5.RELEASE/reference/html5/#webflux-oauth2-resource-server[Spring Security 5.1 Reference Documentation] on how to implement a resource server.
====

==== Implementation steps

First step is to configure an OAuth2 resource server. For this you have to register the corresponding
identity server/authorization server to use.

Spring security 5 uses the
[OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) specification
to completely configure the resource server to use our keycloak instance.

Navigate your web browser to the url [localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/.well-known/openid-configuration](http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/.well-known/openid-configuration).
Then you should see the public discovery information that keycloak provides
(like the following that only shows partial information).

[source,json]
----
{
  "issuer": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop",
  "authorization_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/auth",
  "token_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/token",
  "userinfo_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo",
  "jwks_uri": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/protocol/openid-connect/certs"
}
----

For configuring a resource server the important entries are _issuer_ and _jwks_uri_.
Spring Security 5 automatically configures a resource server by just specifying the _issuer_ uri value
as part of the predefined spring property _spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri_


.application.yml file

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-resource-server-properties.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
An error you get very often with files in yaml format is that the indents are not correct.
This can lead to unexpected errors later when you try to run all this stuff.
====

With this configuration in place we have already a working resource server
that can handle JWt access tokens transmitted via http bearer token header.
Spring Security also validates by default:

* the JWT signature against the queried public key(s) from jwks_url
* the JWT _iss_ claim against the configured issuer uri
* that the JWT is not expired

The issuer URI is used to retrieve the well known OpenID Connect configuration.

.http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/workshop/.well-known/openid-configuration

include::../snippets/step-5-well-known-oidc-config.adoc[]

The web security configuration looks like the ones we have seen before with all that authorization
rule settings. The addition here is just for replacing the basic authentication with bearer token authentication
(expected in the http header). Additionally there are two possible alternative JWT converters referenced there.

Usually this configuration would be sufficient but as we also want to make sure that
our resource server is working with stateless token authentication we have to configure stateless
sessions (i.e. prevent _JSESSION_ cookies).
Starting with Spring Boot 2 you always have to configure Spring Security
yourself as soon as you introduce a class that extends _WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter_.

.WebSecurityConfiguration.java file

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-resource-server-websecurity.adoc[]

This configuration above...

* configures stateless sessions (i.e. no _JSESSION_ cookies)

* disables CSRF protection (without session cookies we do not need this any more)
(which also makes it possible to make post requests on the command line)

* protects any request (i.e. requires authentication)

* enables this as a resource server with expecting access tokens in JWT format

With mapping user information like roles you always have the choice between

* Getting the roles information from the JWT token payload
* Getting the roles information from the mapped local persistent user

The converter for getting roles from JWT token looks like the following:

.LibraryUserJwtAuthenticationConverter.java file

include::../snippets/step-5-library-user-jwt-converter.adoc[]

The converter for using the roles from the mapped local user looks like this:

.LibraryUserRolesJwtAuthenticationConverter.java file

include::../snippets/step-5-library-user-roles-jwt-converter.adoc[]

To start the resource server simply run the class _LibraryServerApplication_ in
project *lab-5/complete-resource-server*.

In the following paragraphs we now proceed to the client side of the OAuth2/OIDC part.

[[oauth2-login-client]]
=== Lab 6: OpenID Connect Client

[[client-gradle-dependencies]]
==== Gradle dependencies

To use the new OAuth2 client support of Spring Security 5.1 you have to add the
following required dependencies to the existing gradle build file.

.gradle.build file

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-client-gradle-build.adoc[]

==== Implementation steps

First step is to configure an OAuth2/OIDC client. For this you have to register the corresponding
identity server/authorization server to use.
Here you have two possibilities:

. You can just use one of the predefined ones (Facebook, Google, etc.).
. You register your own custom server.

Spring security provides the enumeration _CommonOAuth2Provider_ which defines registration details
for a lot of well-known identity providers.

.CommonOAuth2Provider class

include::../snippets/step-5-common-oauth2-provider.adoc[]

To use one of these providers is quite easy. Just reference the enumeration constant as the provider.

.Google provider properties class

include::../snippets/step-5-google-oauth2-provider-properties.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
You can find a sample application using the common provider for GitHub in project *intro-labs/github-client*.
====

But in this workshop we will focus on the second possibility and use our own custom identity provider service. +
To achieve this we add the following sections to the _application.yml_ file.

Spring security 5 uses the
[OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) specification
to completely configure the client to use our keycloak instance.

For configuring an OAuth2 client the important entries are _issuer_, _authorization_endpoint_,
_token_endpoint_, _userinfo_endpoint_ and _jwks_uri_.
Spring Security 5 automatically configures an OAuth2 client by just specifying the _issuer_ uri value
as part of the predefined spring property _spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.[id].issuer-uri_.

For OAuth2 clients you always have to specify the client registration (with client id, client secret,
authorization grant type, redirect uri to your client callback and optionally the scope).
The client registration requires an OAuth2 provider. If you want to use your own provider you have to configure
at least the _issuer uri_. We want to change the default user name mapping for the user identity as well (
using the user name instead of the default value 'sub').

.application.yml client configuration

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-client-properties.adoc[]

As the library-server is now configured as an OAuth2 resource server it requires
a valid JWT token to successfully call the _/books_ endpoint now.

For all requests to the resource server we use the reactive web client, that was introduced by Spring 5.
WebClient is the successor of _RestTemplate_ and works for both worlds (Servlet-based and reactive).

The next required step is to make this web client aware of transmitting the required bearer access tokens
in the _Authorization_ header.

To support JWT tokens in calls we have to add a client interceptor to the _WebClient_.
The following code snippet shows how this is done:

.WebClientConfiguration class

include::../snippets/step-5-webclient-configuration.adoc[]

With these additions we add a filter function to the web client that automatically adds the
access token to all requests and also initiates the authorization grant flow if no valid
access token is available.

Finally, we need an updated client side security configuration to allow
client endpoints and enable the OAuth2 client features:

.SecurityConfiguration class

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-client-security-configuration.adoc[]

The client is build as a Thymeleaf web client. Thymeleaf basically works with HTML template files with some
specials tags to connect the template with Spring beans.

In our case there are already 3 HTML templates:

* index.html: The main template that is displayed initially to show list of books
* createbookform.html: This renders a form to create a new book
* users.html: This shows the list of users retrieved from the library server
* error.html: Template to show errors

To map these HTML template files to the web request paths and also map the content (the 'model' as it is called
in Spring MVC) a controller class (annotated with _@Controller_) is required.

The corresponding class for the '/books' request is shown here.

.BookController class

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-client-book-controller.adoc[]

In the client you can see the contents of the ID JWT token as well using the '/userinfo' endpoint.
This endpoint is mapped to a _@RestController_.

.UserInfoRestController class

include::../snippets/step-5-oauth2-client-user-info-rest-controller.adoc[]

===== Run all the components

Finally start the two components:

* Run _CompleteResourceServerApplication_ class in project *lab-5/complete-resource-server*
* Run _InitialOidcClientApplication_ class in project *lab-6/initial-oidc-client*

Now when you access http://localhost:9090/userinfo[localhost:9090/userinfo] you should be redirected to the keycloak identity server.
After logging in you should get the current authenticated user info back from identity server.

Here you can log in using one of these predefined users:

.User credentials
|===
| Username | Email | Password | Roles
|bwayne
|bruce.wayne@example.com
|wayne
|LIBRARY_USER
|bbanner
|bruce.banner@example.com
|banner
|LIBRARY_USER
|pparker
|peter.parker@example.com
|parker
|LIBRARY_CURATOR
|ckent
|clark.kent@example.com
|kent
|LIBRARY_ADMIN
|===

You can now access http://localhost:9090[localhost:9090] as well.
This returns the book list from the library-server (resource server).

===== Logout Users

After you have logged in into the library client using keycloak your session will remain valid until
the access token has expired or the session at keycloak is invalidated.

As the library client does not have a logout functionality, you have to follow the following steps to actually log out
users:

* Login to keycloak http://localhost:8080/auth/admin[admin console] and navigate on the left to menu item _session_
Here you'll see all user sessions (active/offline ones). By clicking on button _Logout all_ you can revocate
all active sessions.

image::images/keycloak_sessions.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="novatec"]

* After you have revoked sessions in keycloak you have to delete the current _JSESSION_ cookie
for the library client. You can do this by opening the application tab in the developer tools of chrome.
Navigate to the cookies entry on the left and select the url of the library client, then delete the cookie
on the right hand side

image::images/devtools_cookies.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="novatec"]

Now when you refresh the library client in the browser you should be redirected again to the login page of keycloak.

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project *lab-6/complete-oidc-client*.

This concludes our Spring Security 5 hands-on workshop.
I hope you have learned a lot regarding security and especially Spring Security 5.

[TIP]
