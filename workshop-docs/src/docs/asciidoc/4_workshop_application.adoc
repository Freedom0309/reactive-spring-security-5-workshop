== The workshop application

In this workshop you will be provided a finished but completely unsecured reactive
web application.
This library server application provides a https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html[RESTful service]
for administering books and users.

You can find this provided workshop application in sub project **lab-1/initial-library-server**.

This will also be your **starting point** into the hands-on part that we will dive into shortly.

.The workshop application

The RESTful service for books is build using the Spring WebFlux annotation model and the RESTful service for
users is build using the Spring WebFlux router model.

The application contains a complete documentation for the RESTful API build with spring rest docs
which you can find in the directory _build/asciidoc/html5_
after performing a full gradle build.

The domain model of this application is quite simple and just consists of _Book_ and _User_.
The packages of the application are organized as follows:

- *api*: Contains the complete RESTful service
- *business*: All the service classes (quite simple for workshop, usually containing business logic)
- *dataaccess*: All domain models and repositories
- *config*: All spring configuration classes
- *common*: Common classes used by several other packages

[NOTE]
====
To call the provided REST API you can use https://curl.haxx.se[curl] or https://httpie.org[httpie].
For details on how to call the REST API please consult
the https://andifalk.github.io/reactive-spring-security-5-workshop/api-doc.html[REST API documentation]
which also provides sample requests for _curl_ and _httpie_.
====

There are three target user roles for this application:

- *Standard users*: A standard user can borrow and return his currently borrowed books
- *Curators*: A curator user can add or delete books
- *Administrators*: An administrator user can add or remove users

If you are going into reactive systems this works best if all layers work in non-blocking reactive style.
Therefore, the application is build using:

- Spring 5 WebFlux on Netty
- Spring Data MongoDB with reactive driver
- In-memory Mongodb to have an easier setup for the workshop
