== Introduction

Target of this workshop is to learn how to make an initially unsecured (reactive) web application
more and more secure step-by-step.

This will be done in following steps:

1. Add spring boot security starter dependency for simple auto configuration of security
2. Customize authentication configuration (provide our own user store)
3. Add authorization (access controls) to web and method layers
4. Implement automated security integration tests
5. Experiment with new OAuth2 Login Client and Resource Server of Spring Security 5.1

=== Requirements for this workshop

* Git
* A Java JDK (Java 8, 9 or 11 are supported and tested)
* Any Java IDE capable of building with https://gradle.org/[Gradle] (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, ...)

== Common Web Security Risks

In this workshop you will strive various parts of securing a web application that
fit into the https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10[OWASP Top 10 2017 list].

We will look at:

- A2: Broken Authentication
- A3: Sensitive Data Exposure
- A5: Broken Access Control
- A6: Security Misconfiguration
- A10: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

image::images/owasp_top_10_2017.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="owasp_top_10"]

The https://owasp.org[Open Web Application Security Project] has plenty of further free resources available.

As a developer you may also have a look into the https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls[OWASP ProActive Controls] document which describes how to develop
your applications using good security patterns.
To help getting all security requirements right for your project and how to test these the https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS[Application Security Verification Standard] can help you here.

[NOTE]
====
You will find more sources of information about security referenced in the appendix section.
====

== The workshop application

In this workshop you will be provided a finished but completely unsecured reactive
web application. This library server application provides a https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html[RESTful service] for administering books and users.

The RESTful service for books is build using the Spring WebFlux annotation model and the RESTful service for
users is build using the Spring WebFlux router model.

The application contains a complete documentation for the RESTful API build with spring rest docs
which you can find in the directory _build/asciidoc/html5_
after performing a full gradle build.

The domain model of this application is quite simple and just consists of _Book_ and _User_.
The packages of the application are organized as follows:

- *api*: Contains the complete RESTful service
- *business*: All the service classes (quite simple for workshop, usually containing business logic)
- *dataaccess*: All domain models and repositories
- *config*: All spring configuration classes

[NOTE]
====
For users of IntelliJ you find http scripts to test all the RESTful services in sub directory _http_
of all projects.
====

There are three target user roles for this application:

- *Standard users*: A standard user can borrow and return his currently borrowed books
- *Curators*: A curator user can add or delete books
- *Administrators*: An administrator user can add or remove users

The application is build using

- Spring 5 WebFlux on Netty
- Spring Data MongoDB with reactive driver
- In-memory Mongodb to have an easier setup for the workshop

The following subsections give a very condensed introduction to the basics of Reactive Systems,
the Project Reactor and Spring WebFlux. +
This might help to better understand the sample application for beginners of Reactive.

=== Reactive Systems & Streams

[quote, https://www.reactivemanifesto.org]
Reactive Systems are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven (Asynchronous).

* *Responsiveness* means the system responds in a timely manner and is the cornerstone of usability
* *Resilience* means the system stays responsive in the face of failure
* *Elasticity* means that the throughput of a system scales up or down automatically to
meet varying demand as resource is proportionally added or removed
* *Message Driven* systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components
that ensures loose coupling

[quote, http://www.reactive-streams.org/]
Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure..

* *Back-Pressure*: When one component is struggling to keep-up, the system as a whole needs to respond in a sensible way.
Back-pressure is an important feedback mechanism that allows systems to gracefully respond to load rather than
collapse under it.

==== Project Reactor

The project https://projectreactor.io[Reactor] is a Reactive library for building non-blocking applications on
the JVM based on the http://www.reactive-streams.org[Reactive Streams Specification] and can help to build
Reactive Systems.

Reactor is a fully non-blocking foundation and offers backpressure-ready
network engines for HTTP (including Websockets), TCP and UDP.

Reactor introduces composable reactive types that implement Publisher but also provide a rich vocabulary of operators,
most notably _Flux_ and _Mono_.

A _Mono<T>_ is a specialized _Publisher<T>_ that emits at most one item and then optionally terminates with
an onComplete signal or an onError signal.

.Mono, an Asynchronous 0-1 Result (source: projectreactor.io)

image::images/mono.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="reactor_mono"]

A _Flux<T>_ is a standard _Publisher<T>_ representing an asynchronous sequence of 0 to N emitted items,
optionally terminated by either a completion signal or an error.

.Flux, an Asynchronous Sequence of 0-N Items (source: projectreactor.io)

image::images/flux.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="reactor_flux"]

==== Spring WebFlux

https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux[Spring WebFlux]
was added in Spring Framework 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs
on servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.

Spring Webflux depends on Reactor and uses it internally to compose asynchronous logic
and to provide Reactive Streams support. +
It provides two programming models:

* Annotated Controllers: This is uses the same annotations as in the Spring MVC part
* Functional Endpoints:  This provides aâ€‰lambda-based, lightweight, functional programming model

== Workshop Organization

This interactive hands-on workshop is organized into several step with one step building upon each other.
There is a separate project for each step:

* **reactive-playground**: This project provides a playground to try reactive streams with project reactor
* **00-library-server**: This contains the initial unsecured application
* **01-library-server**: This has just added the spring boot starter dependencies for spring security
* **02-library-server**: This adds a persistent user store for authentication
* **03-library-server**: This adds custom authentication and authorization rules
* **04-library-server**: This adds automatic integration tests for authorization
* **05-oauth2**: This adds an OAuth2/OIDC login client and resource server for interacting with an identity server for login

== Workshop Steps

To start the workshop please begin by adapting the _00-library-server_ application.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not able to keep up with completing a particular step you
always can just start over with the existing application of next step.

For example if you could not manage to complete the tutorial based on _01-library-server_
just continue using _02-library-server_.
====

=== Step 1: Auto Configuration

.In the first step we start quite easy by just adding the spring boot starter dependency for spring security.

We just need to add the following two dependencies to the _build.gradle_ file of the initial application (_00-library-server_).

.build.gradle

include::{snippets}/step-1-gradle-build.adoc[]

Please start the application by running the class _LibraryServerApplication_.

image::images/loginform.png[scaledwidth="40%", scaledheight="40%",alt="owasp_top_10"]

If you browse to http://localhost:8080/books[localhost:8080/books] then you will notice
that a login form appears in the browser window.

[TIP]
====
But wait - what are the credentials for a user to log in?

With spring security autoconfigured by spring boot the credentials are as follows:

* Username=user
* Password=<Look into the console log!>
====

.console log

include::{snippets}/step-1-default-password-console.adoc[]

As you can see, if Spring Security is on the classpath,
then the web application is secured by default.
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security[Spring boot] auto-configured
basic authentication and form based authentication for all web endpoints.

This also applies to all actuator endpoints like http://localhost:8080/actuator/health[/actuator/health].
All monitoring web endpoints can now only be accessed with an authenticated user.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security-actuator[Actuator Security]
for details.

==== Common Security Problems

Additionally spring security improved the security of the web application automatically for:

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#ns-session-fixation[Session Fixation]:
Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session. +
If you want to learn more about this please read the https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation[Session Fixation page at OWASP]
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#csrf[Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]:
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. +
If you want to know what CSRF really is and how to mitigate this attack please consult https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)[CSRF attack description at OWASP]

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#default-security-headers[Default Security Headers]:
This automatically adds all recommended security response headers to all http responses. You can find more information about this topic
   in the https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project#tab=Main[OWASP Secure Headers Project]

.default security response headers

include::{snippets}/step-1-security-response-header.adoc[]

Spring security 5 also added a bit more user friendly logout functionality out of the box.
If you direct your browser to http://localhost:8080/logout[localhost:8080/logout] you will see the following
dialog on the screen.

image::images/logoutform.png[scaledwidth="40%", scaledheight="40%",alt="owasp_top_10"]

This concludes the first step.

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project _01-library-server_.
====

Now let's proceed to next step and start with customizing the authentication part.

=== Step 2: Customize Authentication

.Now it is time to start customizing the auto-configuration.

The spring boot auto-configuration will back-off a bit in this step and will back-off completely in next step.

Before we start let's look into some internal details how spring security works
for the reactive web stack.

==== WebFilter

Like the _javax.servlet.Filter_ in the blocking servlet-based web stack there is a comparable functionality
in the reactive world: The _WebFilter_.

.WebFilter

include::{snippets}/step-2-web-filter.adoc[]

By using the _WebFilter_ you can add functionality that called around each request and response.

.Spring Security WebFilter
|===
|Filter |Description
|AuthenticationWebFilter
|Performs authentication of a particular request
|AuthorizationWebFilter
|Determines if an authenticated user has access to a specific object
|CorsWebFilter
|Handles CORS preflight requests and intercepts
|CsrfWebFilter
|Applies <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)" >CSRF</a> protection using a synchronizer token pattern.
|===

To see how such a _WebFilter_ works we will implement a simple _LoggingWebFilter_:

.LoggingWebFilter

include::{snippets}/step-2-logging-web-filter.adoc[]

==== WebFilterChainProxy

In step 1 we just used the auto configuration of Spring Boot.
This configured default security settings as follows:

.Default security configuration (with Spring Boot)

include::{snippets}/step-2-default-security-config.adoc[]

As you can see this uses a _SecurityWebFilterChain_ as central component.

.SecurityWebFilterChain

include::{snippets}/step-2-security-web-filter-chain.adoc[]

To customize the spring security configuration you have to implement one or more
of _SecurityWebFilterChain_ configuration methods.

These are handled centrally by the _WebFilterChainProxy_ class.

.WebFilterChainProxy

include::{snippets}/step-2-web-filter-chain-proxy.adoc[]

==== Encrypting Passwords

We start by replacing the default user/password with our own persistent user storage (already present in MongoDB).
To do this we add a new class _WebSecurityConfiguration_ to package _com.example.library.server.config_ having the following
contents.

.WebSecurityConfiguration class

include::{snippets}/step-2-password-encoder-config.adoc[]

The _WebSecurityConfiguration_ implementation does two important things:

. This adds the _SecurityWebFilterChain_. If you already have secured servlet based spring mvc web applications
  then you might know what's called the
  https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#security-filter-chain[_spring security filter chain_].
  In spring webflux the _SecurityWebFilterChain_ is the similar approach
  based on matching a request with one or more WebFilter.
. Configures a _PasswordEncoder_. A password encoder is used by spring security to encrypt passwords and to check
  if a given password matches the encrypted one.

.PasswordEncoder interface

include::{snippets}/step-2-password-encoder.adoc[]

In spring security 5 creating an instance of the _DelegatingPasswordEncoder_ is much easier by using the class _PasswordEncoderFactories_.

.DelegatingPasswordEncoder class

include::{snippets}/step-2-delegating-password-encoder.adoc[]

To have encrypted passwords in our MongoDB store we need to tweak our existing _DataInitializer_ a bit with the
_PasswordEncoder_ we just have configured.

.DataInitializer class

include::{snippets}/step-2-data-initializer.adoc[]

==== Persistent User Storage

Now that we already have configured the encrypting part for passwords of our user storage
we need to connect our own user store (the users already stored in the MongoDB) with spring security's
authentication manager.

This is done in two steps:

In the first step we need to implement spring security's definition of a user called _UserDetails_.

.LibraryUser class

include::{snippets}/step-2-library-user.adoc[]

In the second step we need to implement spring security's interface _ReactiveUserDetailsService_ to integrate our user store with the authentication manager.

.LibraryReactiveUserDetailsService class

include::{snippets}/step-2-library-user-details-service.adoc[]

After completing this part of the workshop we now still have the auto-configured _SecurityWebFilterChain_ but we have
replaced the default user with our own users from our MongoDB persistent storage.

If you restart the application now you have to use the following user credentials to log in:

.User credentials
|===
|User |Password |Roles
|user@example.com
|user
|USER
|curator@example.com
|curator
|USER, CURATOR
|admin@example.com
|admin
|USER, CURATOR, ADMIN
|===

==== Automatic Password Encryption Updates

TODO

This is the end of step 2 of the workshop.

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project _02-library-server_.
====

In the next workshop part we also adapt the _SecurityWebFilterChain_ to our needs and add authorization rules (in web and method layer)
for our application.

=== Step 3: Add Authorization

.In this part of the workshop we want to add our customized authorization rules for our application.

As a result of the previous workshop steps we now have authentication for all our web endpoints
(including the actuator endpoints) and we can log in using our own users. But here security does not stop.

We know who is using our application (*authentication*) but we do not have control over what this user is
allowed to do in our application (*authorization*).

As a best practice the authorization should always be implemented on different layers like the web and method layer.
This way the authorization still prohibits access even if a user manages to bypass the web url based authorization filter
by playing around with manipulated URL's.

Our required authorization rule matrix looks like this:

.Authorization rules for library-server
|===
|URL | Http method|Restricted|Roles with access
|/*.css,/*.jpg,/*.ico,...
|All
|No
|--
|/books
|POST
|Yes
|CURATOR
|/books
|DELETE
|Yes
|CURATOR
|/users
|All
|Yes
|ADMIN
|/actuator/health
|GET
|No
|--
|/actuator/info
|GET
|No
|--
|/actuator/*
|GET
|Yes
|ADMIN
|/*
|All
|Yes
|All authenticated ones
|===

All the web layer authorization rules are configured in the _WebSecurityConfiguration_ class by adding
a new bean for _SecurityWebFilterChain_. Here we also already switch on the support for method layer authorization
by adding the annotation _@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity_.

.WebSecurityConfiguration class

include::{snippets}/step-3-spring-security-filter-chain.adoc[]

We also add a a _ServerLogoutSuccessHandler_ bean to redirect back to the _/books_ endpoint after a logout
to omit the error message we got so far by redirecting to a non-existing page.

We continue with authorization on the method layer by adding the rules to our business service classes
_BookService_ and _UserService_. To achieve this we use the _@PreAuthorize_ annotations provided by spring security.
Same as other spring annotations (e.g. @Transactional) you can put _@PreAuthorize_ annotations on global class level
or on method level.

Depending on your authorization model you may use _@PreAuthorize_ to authorize using static roles or
to authorize using dynamic expressions (usually if you have roles with permissions).

.Roles and Permissions

image::images/roles_permissions.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="roles_permissions"]

If you want to have a permission based authorization you can use the predefined interface _PermissionEvaluator_ inside the
_@PreAuthorize_ annotations like this:

```
class MyService {
    @PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#uuid, 'user', 'write')")
    void myOperation(UUID uuid) {...}
}
```

.PermissionEvaluator class

include::{snippets}/step-3-permission-evaluator.adoc[]

In the workshop due to time constraints we have to keep things simple so we just use static roles. +
Here it is done for the all operations of the book service.

.BookService class

include::{snippets}/step-3-book-authorization.adoc[]

And now we add it the same way for the all operations of the user service.

.UserService class

include::{snippets}/step-3-user-authorization.adoc[]

Now that we have the current user context available in our application we can use this to automatically
set this user as the one who has borrowed a book or returns his borrowed book. The current user can always be evaluated
using the _ReactiveSecurityContextHolder_ class. But a more elegant way is to just let the framework put the current user
directly into our operation via _@AuthenticationPrincipal_ annotation.

.BookRestController class

include::{snippets}/step-3-authentication-principal.adoc[]

So please go ahead and re-start the application and try to borrow a book with an authenticated user.
If you are an IntelliJ user you can use the provided _book.http_ file in subdirectory _http_.

At first you will notice that even with the correct basic authentication header you get an error message like this one:

.CSRF error output

include::{snippets}/step-3-csrf-error.adoc[]

The library-server expects a CSRF token in the request but did not find one. If you use common UI frameworks like
Thymeleaf or JSF (on the serverside) or a clientside one like Angular then these already handle this CSRF processing.

In our case we do not have such handler. To successfully tra the borrow book request you have to switch off
CSRF in the library server. +
This is done like this in the _WebSecurityConfiguration_ class.

.Disable CSRF

include::{snippets}/step-3-csrf-disable.adoc[]

Restart the application and retry to borrow a book. This time the request should be successful.

[CAUTION]
====
Do not disable CSRF on productive servers if you use session cookies, otherwise you are vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
You may safely disable CSRF for servers that use a stateless authentication approach with bearer tokens like
for OAuth2 or OpenID Connect.
====

In this workshop step we added the authorization to web and method layers. So now for particular RESTful endpoints access is only
permitted to users with special roles.

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project _03-library-server_.
====

But how do you know that you have implemented all the authorization rules and did not leave a big security leak
for your RESTful API? Or you may change some authorizations later by accident?

To be on a safer side here you need automatic testing. Yes, this can also be done for security!
We will see how this works in the next workshop part.

=== Step 4: Security Testing

.Now it is time to prove that we have implemented these authorization rules correctly with automatic testing.

We start testing the rules on method layer for all operations regarding books.

The tests will be implemented using the new JUnit 5 version as Spring 5.0 now supports this as well. +
In _BookServiceTest_ class we also use the new convenience annotation _@SpringJUnitConfig_ which is a shortcut of
_@ExtendWith(value=SpringExtension.class)_ and _@ContextConfiguration_.

As you can see in the following code only a small part is shown as a sample here to test the _BookService.create()_ operation.
Authorization should always be tested for positive *AND* negative test cases. Otherwise you probably miss an authorization
constraint. Depending on the time left in the workshop you can add some more test cases as you like or just look into the
completed application _04-library-server_.

.BookServiceTest class

include::{snippets}/step-4-book-authorization-test.adoc[]

For sure you have to add similar tests as well for the user part.

.UserServiceTest class

include::{snippets}/step-4-user-authorization-test.adoc[]

The testing part is the last part of adding security to the reactive style of the _library-server_
project.

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project _04-library-server_.
====

In the last workshop part we will look at the new OAuth2 login client and resource server introduced in Spring Security 5.0 and 5.1.

=== Step 5: OAuth2/OpenID Connect

==== OAuth 2.0

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0] is the base protocol for authorizing 3rd party authentication services
for using business services in the internet like https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow].

image::images/oauth_roles.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="oauth_roles"]

Authorizations are permitted via scopes that the user has to confirm before
using the requested service.

Depending on the application type OAuth 2.0 provides the following grants (flows):

- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[Authorization Code Grant]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[Authorization Code Grant with PKCE]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2[Implicit Grant]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3[Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4[Client Credentials Grant]

==== OpenID Connect 1.0

https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect 1.0 (OIDC)] is build upon https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth2] and provides additional identity information
to OAuth2. For common enterprise applications that typically require authentication OpenID Connect should be used.
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OIDC] adds https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON web tokens (JWT)] as mandatory format for id tokens to the spec.
In OAuth2 the format of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[bearer tokens] is not specified.

image::images/openid_roles.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="openid_roles"]

OIDC adds an id token in addition to the access token of OAuth2 and specifies
a user info endpoint to retrieve further user information using the access token.

OIDC supports the following grant flows:

- https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow]
- https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth[Implicit Flow]
- https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth[Hybrid Flow]

==== Tokens in OIDC and OAuth 2.0

Tokens can be used in two ways:

1. Self-contained token (containing all information directly in token payload, e.g. JWT)
2. Reference token (token is used to look up further information)

==== OAuth2/OIDC in Spring Security 5

.Spring Security 5.0 introduced new support for OAuth2/OpenID Connect (OIDC) directly in spring security.

In short Spring Security 5.0 adds a completely rewritten implementation for OAuth2/OIDC which now is largely based
on a third party library https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-oauth-openid-connect-sdk[Nimbus OAuth 2.0 SDK] instead of implementing all these functionality directly in Spring itself.

Spring Security 5.0 only provides the client side for servlet-based clients.

Spring Security 5.1 adds the resource server support and reactive support
for reactive clients and resource server as well.

Spring Security 5.2 adds client support for authorization code flow with PKCE.

Spring Security 5.3 will add a basic OAuth2/OIDC authorization server again (for local dev
and demos but not for productive use).

Before Spring Security 5.0 and Spring Boot 2.0 to implement OAuth2 you needed the separate project module
https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth2].

Now things have changed much, so it heavily depends now on the combination of Spring Security and Spring Boot versions
that are used how to implement OAuth2/OIDC.

Therefore you have to be aware of different approaches for Spring Security 4.x/Spring Boot 1.5.x
and Spring Security 5.x/Spring Boot 2.x.

.OAuth2 support in Spring Security + Spring Boot

^2^ New rewritten OAuth2 login client included in Spring Security 5.0 +
^3^ No direct support in Spring Security 5.0/Spring Boot 2.0. For auto-configuration with Spring Boot 2.0
you still have to use the separate https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth project]
together with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth2-boot[Spring Security OAuth2 Boot compatibilty project] +
^4^ New refactored support for resource server as part of Spring Security 5.1 +
^5^ OAuth2 login client and resource server with reactive support as part of Spring Security 5.1. +
^6^ New OAuth2 authorization server is planned as part of Spring Security 5.2

[TIP]
====
The OAuth2/OpenID Connect Authorization Server provided by Spring Security 5.3 will mainly suit for fast prototyping and demo
purposes. For production please use one of the https://openid.net/developers/certified/[officially certified] products like for example
https://www.keycloak.org/[KeyCloak], https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa[UAA], https://identityserver.io[IdentityServer], https://auth0.com[Auth0] or https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/[Okta].

In this workshop we will now look at what Spring Security 5.1 provides as new
OAuth2/OIDC Login Client and Resource Server - In a reactive way.

==== What we will build

In the _05-oauth2_ project you will be provided the following sub-projects:

* *uaa*: This is the OAuth2/OIDC identity management service of CloudFoundry which holds all users with their credentials.

* *initial-library-server*: The reactive version of the library server (similar to previous workshop step _04-library-server_)

* *initial-oauth2-login-client*: Initial code for this workshop part to implement the new OAuth2 Login Client

* *oauth2-login-client*: Complete code of the new OAuth2 Login Client (for reference)

* *oauth2-library-server*: Complete code of the reactive library OAuth2 resource server

[NOTE]
====
The spring implementation of the authorization server previously used (based on Spring Boot 1.5.x) is not
fully compliant with OIDC and therefore not usable any more with OAuth2/OIDC implementation
of Spring Security 5.1.

These microservices have to be configured to be reachable via the following URL addresses (Port 8080 is the default port in spring boot).

.Microservice URL Adresses
|===
|Microservice |URL
|Identity Management Server (UAA)
|http://localhost:8090/uaa
|Library Client (OAuth2 Login Client)
|http://localhost:8081
|Library-Server (OAuth2 Resource Server)
|http://localhost:8080
|===

So now let's start.
Again, you will just use the provided _uaa_ identity management server, the _initial-library-server_
and the _initial-oauth2-login-client_ as starting point and implement
a OAuth2 resource server and login client based on the project.

But first read important information about how to start the required _uaa_ identity management server.

[[identity-server]]
==== UAA Identity Server

For this workshop the OpenID Connect certified https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa[UAA identity server] is provided.
UAA is an abbreviation for CloudFoundry User Account and Authentication.
This server is issuing OAuth2/OIDC JSON web tokens.

[TIP]
====
You may look into https://openid.net/certification/[OpenID Connect certified products]
to find a suitable identity management server for your project.
====

To start the UAA component you need an installed https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] server.

1. Please https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi[download] most current version of the Apache Tomcat 8.x line and
extract the downloaded archive in a directory of your choice.
2. Open the file _05-oauth2/uaa/build.gradle_ and replace the path entry for _tomcatHomeDir_ with the
directory you have extracted the Apache Tomcat files into.
3. Execute ```./gradlew downloadUAA``` to download required war file for UAA
4. Execute ```./gradlew cargoRunLocal``` to start the UAA server

Wait until the UAA server has been started.
If you see the output ```Press Ctrl-C to stop the container``` then UAA is ready.
You can also look into the file _05-oauth2/uaa/uaa-server.log_ to see
the corresponding log output for UAA.

To see the configuration please open the following url in your web browser:
(Every OpenID Connect compliant identity server must provide a page at the endpoint _/.../.well-known/openid-configuration_

http://localhost:8090/uaa/oauth/token/.well-known/openid-configuration

The important information provided by this is:

.Identity Server Configuration
|===
|Entry |Description |Value
|issuer
|Issuer url for issued tokens by this identity server
|http://localhost:8090/uaa/oauth/token
|authorization_endpoint
|Handles authorization, usually asking for credentials and returns an authorization code
|http://localhost:8090/uaa/oauth/authorize
|token_endpoint
|Token endpoint (exchanges given authorization code for access token)
|http://localhost:8090/uaa/oauth/token
|userinfo_endpoint
|Endpoint for requesting further user information
|http://localhost:8090/uaa/userinfo
|jwks_uri
|Uri for loading public keys to verify signatures of JSON web tokens
|http://localhost:8090/uaa/token_keys
|===

[[resource-server]]
==== Resource Server (Library-Server)

For this workshop part the well-known library-server application is used and will be extended to act
 as a OAuth2 resource server.

[[client-gradle-dependencies]]
===== Gradle dependencies

To use the new OAuth2 resource server support of Spring Security 5.1 you have to add the
following required dependencies to the existing gradle build file.

.gradle.build file

include::{snippets}/step-5-oauth2-resource-server-gradle-build.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
These dependencies already have been added to the initial project.
====

[TIP]
====
You may look into the spring security oauth2 boot reference documentation
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.0.RC1/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security-oauth2-server[Spring Boot 2.1 Reference Documentation]
and the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.1.1.RELEASE/reference/html5/#webflux-oauth2-resource-server[Spring Security 5.1.1 Reference Documentation] on how to implement a resource server.
====

===== Implementation steps

First step is to configure an OAuth2 resource server. For this you have to register the corresponding
identity server/authorization server to use.

.application.yml file

include::{snippets}/step-5-oauth2-resource-server-properties.adoc[]

.WebSecurityConfiguration.java file

include::{snippets}/step-5-oauth2-resource-server-websecurity.adoc[]

To start the resource server simply run the class _LibraryServerApplication_ in
project _05-oauth2-client/initial-library-server_.

In the following paragraphs we now proceed to the workshop part where your interaction is required again:
The OAuth2 login client.

[[oauth2-login-client]]
==== OAuth2 Login Client

[[client-gradle-dependencies]]
===== Gradle dependencies

To use the new OAuth2 client support of Spring Security 5.0 you have to add the
following required dependencies to the existing gradle build file.

.gradle.build file

include::{snippets}/step-5-oauth2-client-gradle-build.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
These dependencies already have been added to the initial project.
====

===== Implementation steps

First step is to configure an OAuth2 login client. For this you have to register the corresponding
identity server/authorization server to use.
Here you have two possibilities:

. You can just use one of the predefined ones (Facebook, Google, etc.)
. You register your own custom server

Spring security provides the enumeration _CommonOAuth2Provider_ which defines registration details
for a lot of well known identity providers.

.CommonOAuth2Provider class

include::{snippets}/step-5-common-oauth2-provider.adoc[]

To use one of these providers is quite easy. Just reference the enumeration constant as the provider.

.Google provider properties class

include::{snippets}/step-5-google-oauth2-provider-properties.adoc[]

But in this workshop we will focus on the second possibility and use our own local authorization server. +
To achieve this we add the following sections to the _application.yml_ file.

.application.yml client configuration

include::{snippets}/step-5-client-properties.adoc[]

As the library-server is now configured as an OAuth2 resource server it requires
a valid JWT token to successfully call the _/books_ endpoint now.

From client side we use the new _WebClient_ for calls to the RESTful service.
WebClient is the successor of _RestTemplate_ and works for both worlds (Servlet-based and reactive).

To support JWT tokens in calls we have to add a client interceptor to the _RestTemplate_.
The following code snippet shows how this is done:

.WebClientConfiguration class

include::{snippets}/step-5-webclient-configuration.adoc[]

Finally we need an updated client side security configuration to allow
client endpoints and enable the OAuth2 client features:

.SecurityConfiguration class

include::{snippets}/step-5-client-security-configuration.adoc[]

===== Run all the components

Finally start all three components:

* Run _UAA_ server in project _05-oauth2/uaa_
* Run _LibraryServerApplication_ class in project _05-oauth2/initial-library-server_
* Run _OAuth2LoginClientApplication_ class in project _05-oauth2/initial-oauth2-login-client_

Now when you access http://localhost:8081/userinfo[localhost:8081/userinfo] you should be redirected to the UAA identity server.
After logging in you should get the current authenticated user info back from identity server.

Here you can log in using one of these predefined users:

.User credentials
|===
|User |Password |Roles
|user@example.com
|user
|USER
|curator@example.com
|curator
|USER, CURATOR
|admin@example.com
|admin
|USER, CURATOR, ADMIN
|===

You can now access http://localhost:8081/books[localhost:8081/books] as well.
This returns the book list from the library-server (resource server).

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project _05-oauth2/oauth2-login-client_
and _05-oauth2/oauth2-library-server_.
====

This concludes our Spring Security 5.1 hands-on workshop.
I hope you learned a lot regarding security and especially Spring Security 5.1.
