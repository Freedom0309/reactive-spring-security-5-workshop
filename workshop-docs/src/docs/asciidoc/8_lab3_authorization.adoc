== Lab 3: Add Authorization

.In this part of the workshop we want to add our customized authorization rules for our application.

As a result of the previous workshop steps we now have authentication for all our web endpoints
(including the actuator endpoints) and we can log in using our own users. But here security does not stop.

We know who is using our application (*authentication*) but we do not have control over what this user is
allowed to do in our application (*authorization*).

[NOTE]

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control[OWASP Top 10-2017 A5-Broken Access Control]

- With the exception of public resources, deny by default
- Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing CORS usage.
====

As a best practice the authorization should always be implemented on different layers like the web and method layer.
This way the authorization still prohibits access even if a user manages to bypass the web url based authorization filter
by playing around with manipulated URL's.

Our required authorization rule matrix looks like this:

.Authorization rules for library-server
|===
|URL | Http method|Restricted|Roles with access
|/*.css,/*.jpg,/*.ico,...
|All
|No
|--
|/books/{bookId}/borrow
|POST
|Yes
|LIBRARY_USER
|/books/{bookId}/return
|POST
|Yes
|LIBRARY_USER
|/books
|POST
|Yes
|LIBRARY_CURATOR
|/books
|DELETE
|Yes
|LIBRARY_CURATOR
|/users
|All
|Yes
|LIBRARY_ADMIN
|/actuator/health
|GET
|No
|--
|/actuator/info
|GET
|No
|--
|/actuator/*
|GET
|Yes
|LIBRARY_ADMIN
|/*
|All
|Yes
|All authenticated ones
|===

All the web layer authorization rules are configured in the _WebSecurityConfiguration_ class by adding
a new bean for _SecurityWebFilterChain_. Here we also already switch on the support for method layer authorization
by adding the annotation _@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity_.

.WebSecurityConfiguration class

include::../snippets/step-3-spring-security-filter-chain.adoc[]

We also add a a _ServerLogoutSuccessHandler_ bean to redirect back to the _/books_ endpoint after a logout
to omit the error message we got so far by redirecting to a non-existing page.

We continue with authorization on the method layer by adding the rules to our business service classes
_BookService_ and _UserService_. To achieve this we use the _@PreAuthorize_ annotations provided by spring security.
Same as other spring annotations (e.g. @Transactional) you can put _@PreAuthorize_ annotations on global class level
or on method level.

Depending on your authorization model you may use _@PreAuthorize_ to authorize using static roles or
to authorize using dynamic expressions (usually if you have roles with permissions).

.Roles and Permissions

image::images/roles_permissions.png[scaledwidth="50%", scaledheight="50%",alt="roles_permissions"]

If you want to have a permission based authorization you can use the predefined interface _PermissionEvaluator_ inside the
_@PreAuthorize_ annotations like this:

[source,java]
----
class MyService {
    @PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#uuid, 'user', 'write')")
    void myOperation(UUID uuid) {
      //...
    }
}
----

.PermissionEvaluator class

include::../snippets/step-3-permission-evaluator.adoc[]

In the workshop due to time constraints we have to keep things simple so we just use static roles. +
Here it is done for the all operations of the book service.

.BookService class

include::../snippets/step-3-book-authorization.adoc[]

And now we add it the same way for the all operations of the user service.

.UserService class

include::../snippets/step-3-user-authorization.adoc[]

Now that we have the current user context available in our application we can use this to automatically
set this user as the one who has borrowed a book or returns his borrowed book. The current user can always be evaluated
using the _ReactiveSecurityContextHolder_ class. But a more elegant way is to just let the framework put the current user
directly into our operation via _@AuthenticationPrincipal_ annotation.

.BookRestController class

include::../snippets/step-3-authentication-principal.adoc[]

So please go ahead and re-start the application and try to borrow a book with an authenticated user.

.httpie get list of books
[source,shell]
----
http localhost:9091/books --auth 'bruce.wayne@example.com:wayne'
----

.httpie borrow a book
[source,shell]
----
http POST localhost:9091/books/{bookId}/borrow --auth 'bruce.wayne@example.com:wayne'
----

Note: Replace _{bookId}_ with the id of one of the books you have got in the list of books.

.curl get list of books
[source,shell]
----
curl 'http://localhost:8080/books' -i -X GET \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' -u bruce.wayne@example.com:wayne | jq
----

.curl borrow a book
[source,shell]
----
curl 'http://localhost:8080/books/{bookId}/borrow' -i -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' -u bruce.wayne@example.com:wayne | jq
----

Note: Replace _{bookId}_ with the id of one of the books you have got in the list of books.

At first you will notice that even with the correct basic authentication header you get an error message like this one:

.CSRF error output

include::../snippets/step-3-csrf-error.adoc[]

The library-server expects a CSRF token in the request but did not find one. If you use common UI frameworks like
Thymeleaf or JSF (on the serverside) or a clientside one like Angular then these already handle this CSRF processing.

In our case we do not have such handler. To successfully tra the borrow book request you have to switch off
CSRF in the library server. +
This is done like this in the _WebSecurityConfiguration_ class.

.Disable CSRF

include::../snippets/step-3-csrf-disable.adoc[]

Restart the application and retry to borrow a book. This time the request should be successful.

[CAUTION]
====
Do not disable CSRF on productive servers if you use session cookies, otherwise you are vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
You may safely disable CSRF for servers that use a stateless authentication approach with bearer tokens like
for OAuth2 or OpenID Connect.
====

In this workshop step we added the authorization to web and method layers. So now for particular RESTful endpoints access is only
permitted to users with special roles.

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project **lab-3/complete-library-server**.
====

But how do you know that you have implemented all the authorization rules and did not leave a big security leak
for your RESTful API? Or you may change some authorizations later by accident?

To be on a safer side here you need automatic testing. Yes, this can also be done for security!
We will see how this works in the next workshop part.
