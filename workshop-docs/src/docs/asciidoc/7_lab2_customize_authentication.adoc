== Lab 2: Customize Authentication

.Now it is time to start customizing the auto-configuration.

The spring boot auto-configuration will back-off a bit in this lab and will back-off completely in next step.

.Custom authentication with persistent users

Before we start let's look into some internal details how spring security works
for the reactive web stack.

=== WebFilter

Like the _javax.servlet.Filter_ in the blocking servlet-based web stack there is a comparable functionality
in the reactive world: The _WebFilter_.

.WebFilter

include::../snippets/step-2-web-filter.adoc[]

By using the _WebFilter_ you can add functionality that called around each request and response.

.Spring Security WebFilter
|===
|Filter |Description
|AuthenticationWebFilter
|Performs authentication of a particular request
|AuthorizationWebFilter
|Determines if an authenticated user has access to a specific object
|CorsWebFilter
|Handles CORS preflight requests and intercepts
|CsrfWebFilter
|Applies https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)[CSRF] protection using a synchronizer token pattern.
|===

To see how such a _WebFilter_ works we will implement a simple _LoggingWebFilter_:

.LoggingWebFilter

include::../snippets/step-2-logging-web-filter.adoc[]

=== WebFilterChainProxy

In lab 1 we just used the auto configuration of Spring Boot.
This configured the default security settings as follows:

.Default security configuration (with Spring Boot)

include::../snippets/step-2-default-security-config.adoc[]

As you can see this uses a _SecurityWebFilterChain_ as central component.

.SecurityWebFilterChain

include::../snippets/step-2-security-web-filter-chain.adoc[]

To customize the spring security configuration you have to implement one or more
of _SecurityWebFilterChain_ configuration methods.

These are handled centrally by the _WebFilterChainProxy_ class.

.WebFilterChainProxy

include::../snippets/step-2-web-filter-chain-proxy.adoc[]

=== Step 1: Encoding Passwords

[NOTE]
====
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure[OWASP Top 10-2017 A3-Sensitive Data Exposure]

- Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest
- Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions with a work factor (delay factor),
such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt or PBKDF2
====

We start by replacing the default user/password with our own persistent user storage (already present in MongoDB).
To do this we add a new class _WebSecurityConfiguration_ to package _com.example.library.server.config_ having the following
contents.

.WebSecurityConfiguration class

include::../snippets/step-2-password-encoder-config.adoc[]

The _WebSecurityConfiguration_ implementation does two important things:

. This adds the _SecurityWebFilterChain_. If you already have secured servlet based spring mvc web applications
then you might know what's called the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#security-filter-chain[_spring security filter chain_].
In spring webflux the _SecurityWebFilterChain_ is the similar approach
based on matching a request with one or more WebFilter.
. Configures a _PasswordEncoder_. A password encoder is used by spring security to encode (hash) passwords and to check
if a given password matches the encrypted one.

.PasswordEncoder interface

include::../snippets/step-2-password-encoder.adoc[]

In spring security 5 creating an instance of the _DelegatingPasswordEncoder_ is much easier
by using the class _PasswordEncoderFactories_. In past years several previously used password encryption algorithms
have been broken (like _MD4_ or _MD5_). By using _PasswordEncoderFactories_ you always get a configured
_DelegatingPasswordEncoder_ instance that configures a map of _PasswordEncoder_ instances for the recommended password hashing algorithms like

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt[Bcrypt]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt[Scrypt]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2[PBKDF2]

At the time of creating this workshop the _DelegatingPasswordEncoder_ instance configures the _Bcrypt_ algorithm
as the default to be used for encoding new passwords.

If you want to know more about why to use hashing algorithms like Bcrypt, Scrypt or PBKDF2 instead of other ones like SHA-2 then
read the very informative blog post
https://security.blogoverflow.com/2013/09/about-secure-password-hashing[About Secure Password Hashing].

.DelegatingPasswordEncoder class

include::../snippets/step-2-delegating-password-encoder.adoc[]

To have encrypted passwords in our MongoDB store we need to tweak our existing _DataInitializer_ a bit with the
_PasswordEncoder_ we just have configured.

.DataInitializer class

include::../snippets/step-2-data-initializer.adoc[]

=== Step 2: Persistent User Storage

Now that we already have configured the encoding part for passwords of our user storage
we need to connect our own user store (the users already stored in the MongoDB) with spring security's
authentication manager.

This is done in two steps:

In the first step we need to implement spring security's definition of a user called _UserDetails_.

.LibraryUser class

include::../snippets/step-2-library-user.adoc[]

In the second step we need to implement spring security's interface _ReactiveUserDetailsService_ to integrate our user store with the authentication manager.

.LibraryReactiveUserDetailsService class

include::../snippets/step-2-library-user-details-service.adoc[]

After completing this part of the workshop we now still have the auto-configured _SecurityWebFilterChain_ but we have
replaced the default user with our own users from our MongoDB persistent storage.

If you restart the application now you have to use the following user credentials to log in:

==== Users and roles

There are three target user roles for this application:

* LIBRARY_USER: Standard library user who can list, borrow and return his currently borrowed books
* LIBRARY_CURATOR: A curator user who can add, edit or delete books
* LIBRARY_ADMIN: An administrator user who can list, add or remove users

__Important:__ We will use the following users in all subsequent labs from now on:

.User credentials
|===
| Username | Email | Password | Roles
|bwayne
|bruce.wayne@example.com
|wayne
|LIBRARY_USER
|bbanner
|bruce.banner@example.com
|banner
|LIBRARY_USER
|pparker
|peter.parker@example.com
|parker
|LIBRARY_CURATOR
|ckent
|clark.kent@example.com
|kent
|LIBRARY_ADMIN
|===

=== Automatic Password Encoding Updates

We already looked into the _DelegatingPasswordEncoder_ and _PasswordEncoderFactories_. As these classes have knowledge
about all encryption algorithms that are supported in spring security, the framework can detect
an _outdated_ encryption algorithm. By extending our already existing _LibraryReactiveUserDetailsService_ class
with the additionally provided interface _ReactiveUserDetailsPasswordService_ we can now enable an automatic
password encryption upgrade mechanism.

The _ReactiveUserDetailsPasswordService_ interface just defines one more operation.

.ReactiveUserDetailsPasswordService interface

include::../snippets/step-2-reactive-user-details-password-service.adoc[]

First we need a user having a password that is encoded using an _outdated_ hashing algorithm. We achieve this by modifying
the existing _DataInitializer_ class.

.DataInitializer class

include::../snippets/step-2-data-initializer-old-user.adoc[]

To activate support for automatic password encoding upgrades we need to extend our existing
_LibraryReactiveUserDetailsService_ class.

.LibraryReactiveUserDetailsService class

include::../snippets/step-2-library-user-details-password-service.adoc[]

Now restart the application and see what happens if we try to get the list of books using this new
user (username='old@example.com', password='user').

In the console you should see the log output showing the old _MD5_ password being updated to _Bcrypt_ password.

[CAUTION]
====
Never log any sensitive data like passwords, tokens etc., even in hashed format. Also never put such sensitive data
into your version control. And never let error details reach the client (via REST API or web application).
Make sure you disable stacktraces in client error messages using property _server.error.include-stacktrace=never_
====

This is the end of lab 2 of the workshop.

[NOTE]
====
You find the completed code in project **lab-2/complete-library-server**.
====

In the next workshop part we also adapt the _SecurityWebFilterChain_ to our needs and add authorization rules (in web and method layer)
for our application.
