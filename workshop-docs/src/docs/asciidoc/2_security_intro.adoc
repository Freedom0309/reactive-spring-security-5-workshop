The https://owasp.org[Open Web Application Security Project] has plenty of further free resources available.

As a developer you may also have a look into the https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls[OWASP ProActive Controls] document which describes how to develop
your applications using good security patterns.
