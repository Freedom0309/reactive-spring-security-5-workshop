== Reactive Systems & Streams

The following subsections give a very condensed introduction to the basics of Reactive Systems,
the Project Reactor and Spring WebFlux. +
This might help to better understand the sample application for beginners of Reactive.

[quote, https://www.reactivemanifesto.org]
Reactive Systems are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven (Asynchronous).

* *Responsiveness* means the system responds in a timely manner and is the cornerstone of usability
* *Resilience* means the system stays responsive in the face of failure
* *Elasticity* means that the throughput of a system scales up or down automatically to
meet varying demand as resource is proportionally added or removed
* *Message Driven* systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components
that ensures loose coupling

[quote, http://www.reactive-streams.org/]
Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure..

* *Back-Pressure*: When one component is struggling to keep-up, the system as a whole needs to respond in a sensible way.
Back-pressure is an important feedback mechanism that allows systems to gracefully respond to load rather than
collapse under it.

=== Project Reactor

The project https://projectreactor.io[Reactor] is a Reactive library for building non-blocking applications on
the JVM based on the http://www.reactive-streams.org[Reactive Streams Specification] and can help to build
Reactive Systems.

Reactor is a fully non-blocking foundation and offers backpressure-ready
network engines for HTTP (including Websockets), TCP and UDP.

Reactor introduces composable reactive types that implement Publisher but also provide a rich vocabulary of operators,
most notably _Flux_ and _Mono_.

A _Mono<T>_ is a specialized _Publisher<T>_ that emits at most one item and then optionally terminates with
an onComplete signal or an onError signal.

A _Flux<T>_ is a standard _Publisher<T>_ representing an asynchronous sequence of 0 to N emitted items,
optionally terminated by either a completion signal or an error.

=== Spring WebFlux

https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux[Spring WebFlux]
was added in Spring Framework 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs
on servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.

Spring Webflux depends on Reactor and uses it internally to compose asynchronous logic
and to provide Reactive Streams support.
It provides two programming models:

* Annotated Controllers: This is uses the same annotations as in the Spring MVC part
* Functional Endpoints:  This provides a lambda-based, lightweight, functional programming model

=== Intro-Lab: Reactive Programming

Before we dive into the world of security, you have the chance to get a first glimpse on the difference between
imperative and reactive programming style.

To do this we will look into the project **intro-labs/reactive-playground**.

The following resources might be helpful for first steps into the reactive world:

* https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/[Project Reactor Reference Documentation]
* https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator[Which operator do I need?]

=== Intro-Lab: Migrate Apps To Reactive

When moving in the direction of the reactive world, you usually have existing applications still running on blocking servlet stack.

Important to mention is also the fact that you do **NOT** have to migrate all you applications to reactive.
The servlet based stack has proven to work for most applications so this won't go away. If you do not have a present problem with the load on your server application with
threads being exhausted then there is no need to act.

To show a sample migration scenario, we will migrate the following applications to their reactive counterparts:

* A server web application using Spring MVC with the blocking servlet stack on Tomcat
* A client web application using a blocking `RestTemplate` to call the server application

We will now migrate these to Spring WebFlux (the server application) and to using the reactive `WebClient` (the client application).

Let's start by looking into the folder **intro-labs/migrate-to-reactive**.

See the spring reference docs for full coverage of _Spring WebFlux_ and the `WebClient`:
