== Reactive Systems & Streams

The following subsections give a very condensed introduction to the basics of Reactive Systems,
the Project Reactor and Spring WebFlux. +
This might help to better understand the sample application for beginners of Reactive.

[quote, https://www.reactivemanifesto.org]
Reactive Systems are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven (Asynchronous).

* *Responsiveness* means the system responds in a timely manner and is the cornerstone of usability
* *Resilience* means the system stays responsive in the face of failure
* *Elasticity* means that the throughput of a system scales up or down automatically to
meet varying demand as resource is proportionally added or removed
* *Message Driven* systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components
that ensures loose coupling

[quote, http://www.reactive-streams.org/]
Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure..

* *Back-Pressure*: When one component is struggling to keep-up, the system as a whole needs to respond in a sensible way.
Back-pressure is an important feedback mechanism that allows systems to gracefully respond to load rather than
collapse under it.

=== Project Reactor

The project https://projectreactor.io[Reactor] is a Reactive library for building non-blocking applications on
the JVM based on the http://www.reactive-streams.org[Reactive Streams Specification] and can help to build
Reactive Systems.

Reactor is a fully non-blocking foundation and offers backpressure-ready
network engines for HTTP (including Websockets), TCP and UDP.

Reactor introduces composable reactive types that implement Publisher but also provide a rich vocabulary of operators,
most notably _Flux_ and _Mono_.

A _Mono<T>_ is a specialized _Publisher<T>_ that emits at most one item and then optionally terminates with
an onComplete signal or an onError signal.

A _Flux<T>_ is a standard _Publisher<T>_ representing an asynchronous sequence of 0 to N emitted items,
optionally terminated by either a completion signal or an error.

=== Spring WebFlux

https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux[Spring WebFlux]
was added in Spring Framework 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs
on servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.

Spring Webflux depends on Reactor and uses it internally to compose asynchronous logic
and to provide Reactive Streams support.
It provides two programming models:

* Annotated Controllers: This is uses the same annotations as in the Spring MVC part
* Functional Endpoints:  This provides a lambda-based, lightweight, functional programming model

=== Intro-Lab: Reactive Programming

Before we dive into the world of security, you have the chance to get a first glimpse on the difference between
imperative and reactive programming style.

To do this we will look into the project **intro-labs/reactive-playground**.

The following resources might be helpful for first steps into the reactive world:

* https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/[Project Reactor Reference Documentation]
* https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator[Which operator do I need?]
