# Spring Security 5 Workshop

## 04 - Library-Server

This is the completed code of the initially unsecured reactive web application (same as in first step of the workshop).

You may continue from here with the [next step](https://andifalk.github.io/spring-security-5-workshop/#_step_5_oauth2_login_client) of the workshop.

***But please note that you have to start with another initial application for this next step !***
