In order to create a book, the consumer needs to provide an `isbn` number, a
a `title` and a `description` for the new book and `POST` them to `/books`:

include::{snippets}/create-book/http-request.adoc[]

This will create a new book in the library's collection.

include::{snippets}/create-book/http-response.adoc[]

==== Listing all existing Books

All existing books of the library's collection can be retrieved with a `GET`
request on the `/books` resource:

include::{snippets}/get-books/http-request.adoc[]

If there are any books in the library the response would look something like
this:

include::{snippets}/get-books/http-response.adoc[]

==== Getting a Book

Existing books of the library's collection can be retrieved with a `GET`
request on the book's `/books/{id}` resource:
